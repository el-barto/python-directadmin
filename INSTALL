Python Directadmin
==================

*Python implementation of Directadmin's Web API*

Intro
-----
The aim of this project is to provide a simple and clean implementation 
of Directadmin's Web API for Python developers.

Directadmin_ is a popular web control panel. It provides an HTTP API which 
*python-directadmin* intends to implement, to help python developers 
interact with the control panel.

Examples
--------

**List all users**

::
  import directadmin

  api = directadmin.Api("admin", "password", "hostname.com", 2222)
  print api.list_all_users()


**Connect using HTTPS and list all users**

::
  import directadmin

  api = directadmin.Api("admin", \
                        "password", \
                        "hostname.com", \
                        2222, \
                        True)
  print api.list_all_users()

**Create an EndUser** (regular user)

::
  import directadmin

  api = directadmin.Api("admin", "password", "hostname.com")
  user = EndUser('username', \
                 'email@domain.com', \
                 'userpassword', \
                 'domain.com', \
                 'service_package_1', \
                 '1.2.3.4')
  if api.create_user(user, True):
      print "User %s successfuly created" % user['username']
  else:
      print "Failed to create user"


Scripts
-------

Within the source code of this project you will find some sample scripts 
meant to explain how to use the API while performing some basic administrative tasks.
