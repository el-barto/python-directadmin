<h1>Python Directadmin</h1>

_A python implementation of Directadmin's Web API_

== Introduction ==
The aim of this project is to provide a simple and clean implementation of Directadmin's Web API for Python developers.

Directadmin (http://www.directadmin.com) is a popular web control panel. It provides an HTTP API which python-directadmin intends to implement, to help python developers interact with the control panel.

== Install ==

Since version 0.3 python-directadmin comes with an installer script which uses [http://docs.python.org/distutils/ distutils]. 

To install, just run:

{{{
python setup.py install
}}}

== Examples ==

*List all users*
{{{
import directadmin

api = directadmin.Api("admin", "password", "hostname.com", 2222)
print api.list_all_users()
}}}

*Connect using HTTPS and list all users*
{{{
import directadmin

api = directadmin.Api("admin", \
                      "password", \
                      "hostname.com", \
                      2222, \
                      True)
print api.list_all_users()
}}}

*Create an EndUser* (regular user)
{{{
import directadmin

api = directadmin.Api("admin", "password", "hostname.com")
user = EndUser('username', \
               'email@domain.com', \
               'userpassword', \
               'domain.com', \
               'service_package_1', \
               '1.2.3.4')
if api.create_user(user, True):
    print "User %s successfuly created" % user['username']
else:
    print "Failed to create user"
}}}

== Scripts ==

Within the source code of this project you will find some sample scripts meant to explain how to use the API while performing some basic administrative tasks.

Check out the SuspensionScript ([http://code.google.com/p/python-directadmin/source/browse/trunk/scripts/da_suspension code]) and the DaConsole ([http://code.google.com/p/python-directadmin/source/browse/trunk/scripts/da_console code]).
